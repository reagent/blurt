I'm horrible about blogging - it's true.  I'd much rather just dump some nicely formatted stuff out in the ether so that I (and others) can find useful information later.  Sometimes this is code, sometimes it's other random useful links and snippets - the point is that it's *small*.  This micro/tumble/crap-blog is my attempt to create something that I can actually use on a daily basis.

== Goals

This is designed to be ultra light-weight.  That means:

  * No comments
  * No web-based admin interface (MetaWeblog API instead)
  * Single account / profile
  * Single blog
  * No theme support **
  * Specific set of content items (e.g. code / video / image)
  * Possibly trackback support

** I could see myself adding this if others found this software useful.

== Admin

To start adding posts, just point your MetaWeblog-enabled client to this endpoint:

http://yourdomain.com/admin

If you're using TextMate, this means:

  * Bundles -> Blogging -> Setup Blogs
  * Add a line to the config: my_blog http://yourdomain.com/admin
  * Open a new document and select Blog - HTML
  * Add a title and some content, then Bundles -> Blogging -> Post to Blog
